playground for trying stuff out in lua with LÖVE.

Tile system is straight up [this tutorial](https://github.com/kikito/love-tile-tutorial).
Now with some LÖVEly physics learned from [its wiki] (http://love2d.org/wiki/).

It's a real mess in there right now, between the hard globals and loading objects and backdrops all at once in some crazy cross-file bananas remix. Might try to clean it up. We'll see.
